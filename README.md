# S3 Guard

Inspired by [s3auth](https://github.com/yegor256/s3auth), **S3 Guard** is an application that allows you to serve static website content hosted in private Amazon S3 buckets over HTTPS, secured with Basic HTTP Auth.
 
**S3 Guard** is meant to be used as a self-hosted service. One installation is capable of serving multiple websites. Installation is easy, using one of the official images published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mbezhanov/s3-guard/)
